	//Range works on a copy of the data structure it iterates over, so modifying index or value inside the loop, it does not affect the original value
	//Arrays, slices, and strings -> Range iterates as normal 
	//Maps -> iterates over key value pairs but in an unspecified order 
	//Channels -> until the channel is closed 

	//If we do not intend to use the values received, we can assign them to the blank identifier aka _, can prevent memory leaks by allowing the garbage collector to reclaim the memory
